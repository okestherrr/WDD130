                        Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what! Wait a minute, where are you going? The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions.

                        Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship. Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon? Should I have? It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs! I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.
                        
                        If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive! Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything...or anyone. I care! So...what do you think of her, Han? I'm trying not to, kid! Good. Still, she's got a lot of spirit.
                        
                        Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak...very dangerous. Who is this? What's your operating number? Boring conversation anyway. Luke! We're going to have company! Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper? What? Oh...the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker.
                        
                        Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him. I'll make it up to him next year.
