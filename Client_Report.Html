<h2>part 1</h2>
    <p>I drew out a plan but it was basic so I let the lead dev do what they thought was best.</p>
    <p>I talked to them in class.</p>
    <p>yes they did. and advanced it too.</p>
    <p>I wouldnt do any thing different.jbecker05.github.io/wdd130-scott/</p>
<h2>part 2</h2>
    <p>to be honest none of the jr. devs talked to me. </p>
    <p>I did communitcate well with the client though</p>
    <p>I handled publishing the clients site well and sharing it.</p>
    <p>It was good.</p>

<h2>part 3</h2>
    <p>I talked to them in person in class.</p>
    <p>i didnt really know what to do because my client gave me a siteplan but it was like a blueprint with hardly anything inside so I did by best, my 2nd prjoect I was able to guess what to do because I didnt get a site plan but they had a basic layout and my 3rd project- was never started by the sr.developer so I couldnt do anything.</p>
    <p>I was able to contribute as much as I could. </p>
    <p>i didn't really run into many issues with github.</p>

<h2>part 4</h2>
    <p>the most challenging part was that I was a jr. developer and I never got to work on one of my project because the sr.developer didnt start the project. </p>
    <p>I enjoyed trying new things and experiementing on what others liked.</p> 
    <p>I would figure out how to format photos better</p>
    <p>I feel more confident and creative in working on real world projects.</p>
